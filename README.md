#The Great Debate

##Description & Usage

    Capstone project for codeLouisville Front-End Web Development course.

    The Great Debate is a fun and creative idea with real-world
    application.  It's jocular content provides comedic relief to the 
    otherwise very significant debate of whether toilet paper should be 
    installed over or under.  

    Additionally, TGD provides deep insight into 
    a person's pysche by providing astounding details about personality, 
    based on an individuals toilet paper installation preferences.

    Lastly, the display of technical ability with use of HTML, CSS, and JS
    can be described as nothing less than impressive, for a 
    Software Engineer Apprentice. The code works but I don't know why - kidding!
